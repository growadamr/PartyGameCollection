## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Free-form discussion over turns (more natural party game feel)
- Unanimous consensus minus target (prevents hasty accusations)
- Imposters can guess anytime (adds tension, escape route)
- Compile new word list (keep existing game data intact)
- Scale imposters with player count (balance for different group sizes)
- Compiled words from existing game data rather than creating new list (01-01)
- Case-insensitive alphabetical sorting for consistent ordering (01-01)
