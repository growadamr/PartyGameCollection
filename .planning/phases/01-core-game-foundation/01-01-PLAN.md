<objective>
Compile word list for the Imposter game by combining words from existing charades and quick draw prompts.

Purpose: The Imposter game needs a diverse word pool for secret words. Rather than creating new words, we compile from existing game data to ensure words are already suitable for party game contexts.

Output: A new `data/prompts/imposter_words.json` file containing deduplicated, sorted words. Original files remain untouched.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create word list compilation script</name>
  <files>scripts/tools/compile_imposter_words.js</files>
  <action>
Create a Node.js script that:
1. Reads `data/prompts/charades_prompts.json` (Dictionary with category keys, each value is an array of prompt strings)
2. Reads `data/prompts/quick_draw_words.json` (Dictionary with difficulty keys like "easy", "medium", "hard", each value is an array of word strings)
3. Flattens all arrays from both sources
4. Deduplicates using Set
5. Sorts alphabetically (case-insensitive)
6. Writes result to `data/prompts/imposter_words.json` as a JSON array

Script should:
- Use Node.js built-in `fs` module (no external dependencies)
- Print count of words from each source and total unique words
- Handle file read errors gracefully with clear error messages
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `node scripts/tools/compile_imposter_words.js` - should complete without errors and print word counts.
  </verify>
  <done>Script exists at `scripts/tools/compile_imposter_words.js` and runs successfully.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Run compilation and verify output</name>
  <files>data/prompts/imposter_words.json</files>
  <action>
1. Run the compilation script: `node scripts/tools/compile_imposter_words.js`
2. Verify the output file was created at `data/prompts/imposter_words.json`
3. Verify the file contains a valid JSON array of strings
4. Verify charades_prompts.json and quick_draw_words.json are unchanged (git status should not show them modified)
5. Sample check: Ensure some known words from each source appear in the output

Expected output format:
```json
[
  "airplane",
  "apple",
  ...
]
```
  </action>
  <verify>
- `cat data/prompts/imposter_words.json | head -20` shows valid JSON array
- `git diff data/prompts/charades_prompts.json` shows no changes
- `git diff data/prompts/quick_draw_words.json` shows no changes
- Word count is reasonable (expect 100-500 unique words)
  </verify>
  <done>
`imposter_words.json` exists with valid JSON array containing 100+ unique words. Original prompt files unchanged.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] `data/prompts/imposter_words.json` exists and contains valid JSON array
- [ ] Word count printed by script shows reasonable number (100+ unique words)
- [ ] `git status` shows only new files, no modifications to charades_prompts.json or quick_draw_words.json
- [ ] Sample words from both sources are present in output
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. imposter_words.json file exists at correct path
2. File contains valid JSON array of strings (not empty)
3. Words are deduplicated (no duplicates in array)
4. Words are sorted alphabetically
5. Original source files are unmodified (DATA-02 satisfied)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-core-game-foundation/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
